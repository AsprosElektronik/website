            Nate, contacted codequest in his search for a team who
            could make his dream come true. He wanted an app that
            could offer sentimental iPhone users a new way to record
            the story of their lives. Moreover, he wanted an app that
            would allow usersâ€™ voice recordings and messages to be saved
            and shared for the future use within their families and
            friends. Together we created a beautiful app for the people
            to store and share their voice memories in.
