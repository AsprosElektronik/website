In our previous article on remote working we wrote generally about the tools we use to keep our project management and development swift and flawless. Now let’s dive deeper into the topic and see what we use on a daily basis to keep in touch with our clients and teams.

In our line of business communication is the secret to the success of any project. Everyone must have exactly the same information to work well in this fast-paced software development environment. With teams and clients spread all over the world we would not be able to achieve that without these great communication tools:

## Hipchat
[HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/ "HipChat") is a product offered by Atlassian who have a solid bundle of productivity apps available online. We use HipChat internally for our day-to-day communication, monitoring the deployment process, results of automated testing, in-team communication, tutoring, etc.

Sometimes a client wants to have a direct access to his dev team and that is when HipChat comes in handy. We give them access to a room dedicated to their project and the communication is instant.

HipChat is also great for our internal goofing off, when we all feel like we need a break from hard-coding, and need to have a good laugh over something stupid. We can always rely on some members of our team to put funny items onto our private company wall.


## Skype and Google Hangouts
For direct communication with our clients we use [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/ "Skype") or [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/ "Hangouts"). Everybody knows the power of Skype, we can use it practically anywhere with anybody. But it has its capacity limitations so when the team required for the meeting is larger we prefer Google Hangouts as it allows for a more numerous video conferencing party and a convenient screen-sharing. We can also hold there a sprint review or a product demo with the client or our remote team.

## Appear.in
[Appear.in](https://appear.in/ "Appear.in") is a relatively new video conferencing tool we began using some time ago. We switch to it when there is no screen-sharing required (appear.in does not support screen-sharing yet), or when Google Hangouts experience problems, and use it for contacting our clients or for our internal stand-ups. It offers a very good quality video connection and has a nice interface.

## Slack
Mobile communication app, Slack, is used by us for quick and short interaction with our clients. Due to time difference, they need to send some info outside of our working hours. Slack makes it possible for us to respond to their questions or comments out-of-office, or simply have a casual chat with them at any time. We can send each other photos or updates on-the-go, and very often we do so.

Keeping the client well-informed and reacting to their inquiries is crucial for the project’s well-being and smooth and productive cooperation on the project. If the client is on the same plane as their development team it means less problems and misunderstandings and assures smooth progress of the work on the project. The same applies to in-house communication between team members, if they all know where they are and what they should be doing, or if they need support and guidance from other team members, the work flaws smoothly and everybody is happy about their job.
