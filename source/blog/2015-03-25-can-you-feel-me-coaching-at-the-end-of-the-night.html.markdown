<p>As you might have read, code quest team was involved in <a href='#'>Rails Girls Warsaw</a> this year. code quest's own Magda was part of the organising team there and late December last year she asked me to participate as a coach. I gave it a thought and figured I'd give it a try.</p>

```
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
options: {
    helpers: 'src/helpers/helper-*.js'
}
```

I never did anything like Rails Girls. Even though I feel confident with my Ruby and Rails skills, teaching is a whole different story. We share knowledge a lot at code quest and I did quite a few Tech Presentations for the team. But speaking to programmers is a lot easier than being a gateway to the wonderful world of programming for beginners.

It all started on Saturday - my team (shout out to Ania, Maja and Paula) only knew some CSS and HTML so we had lots to cover. We started with setting things up, all the ladies had Windows machines and Rails Installer worked like a charm - within an hour we were up and running! After lunch we successfully created Rails applications and went through the basics.

On the second day we finished the basic functionality of our app. We've allowed creating, updating, showing and deleting of our Diary Entries. Than we've added some awesome style with CSS and Comments with the second database model.
In about 10 hours of the programming sessions we covered basics of HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, HTTP, REST, Programming principles, MVC, Databases, Errors, Gems, Migration etc. That's a lot of stuff!
<p class='citation'>Rails Girls is not a training camp, it is an event meant to spread the passion for programming to new people </p>
, to show people who were not in the programming community what it's all about. Hence the atmosphere was very relaxed - we all had a great time even though we've covered so much.

I knew coaching would bring new challenges. But I was surprised by what was actually challenging. I found that explaining a programming term comprehensively without introducing fifty other new words was very difficult. I'm quite good with metaphors and that definitely helps. Also, when you are moving through the guide time flies by and before you even know it's time to wrap things up. On the second day I was glancing at my watch more often to make sure I am in the spot I want to be.

I fell in love with coaching. I fell in love with Rails Girls. I fell in love with the atmosphere. I fell in love with the people. I fell in love with the Coffee (yet again). Rails Girls was a very cool experience and I recommend it to every developer. I love to push myself and to introduce new members to the programmer community and on that weekend I managed to do both.
