Not long ago we were proud to announce that some members of our Warsaw crew took an active part in [Rails Girls Warsaw](http://railsgirls.com/warsaw "Rails Girls Warsaw") February workshop. This time we would like to share with you our love and pride of the Bialystok branch.

> we would like to propagate the Rails technology among the technical community in Białystok, and encourage its female members to become Rails specialists

[Rails Girls Bialystok](http://railsgirls.com/bialystok "Rails Girls Bialystok") will be organized for the very first time in that lovely place in the east of Poland. code quest has extended its patronage over this event as we would like to propagate the Rails technology among the technical community in Białystok, and encourage its female members to become Rails specialists, quietly hoping to soon have some girls in our all-male Białystok office.

Not only do we sponsor the event but our Białystok crew members, Piotr Protas and Michał Samluk, will be mentoring the participants of the event.

Piotr has been with code quest since 2013 when he joined us as a junior developer. He got his Ruby silver spurs working on Doctory and Contentful apps, and his latest project is so top secret that we cannot talk about it at this moment. He loves Ruby on Rails and would like to share his love with other enthusiasts.

And while Piotr is new to mentoring, Michał, who is our star programmer, is a seasoned tutor. He helped build hacklab.pl where he also ran part of the course. He does a lot of in-house mentoring to our junior team members (Piotr has been introduced to Ruby on Rails by none other but Michal), and is active in Ruby community. Michał knows very well how to use the knowledge he has and how to pass it on to rookies in a nice and friendly way.

There is no doubt that both our gentlemen will be a perfect addition to the Białystok’s Rails Girls’ team and great mentors to all the Rails Girls' ladies.
