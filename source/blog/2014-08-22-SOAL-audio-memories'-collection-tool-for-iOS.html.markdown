There comes a time when nostalgia hits each one of us and we yearn for the things of the past, be it our crazy adventures during college years or hearing our grandmother's voice, or listening to that tune that was on when you met your significant other. It is natural and nothing to be ashamed of.

We miss the good times, we want to relive the happy moments. There are also times when we cannot be present at some celebrations of family or friends but still want to be able to express our wishes, gratitude or love. One way of doing it is to send a text message or a paper card. Or, with modern technology ever present in our lives, record a message and send it.

Nate saw an opportunity here and he got this idea for an app where you could store your happy moments’ recordings and share them with others. He came with it to us and together we forged his very vague “baloon-navigated” concept into a concrete application that soon will be available in the App Store and presented at the TechCrunch next month.

After analysis, long talks and research we decided to use a unique solution that combines a vertical and horizontal scroll, playing and recording options, image placement and tagging. We wanted the app to look great and stand out in the crowd of App Store apps, so we used nice colors, sophisticated animations and transitions. The result is very nice - the Soal app looks good and we expect it to be popular with those who want to start (or continue) their audio journaling mission.

In the future Soal will offer a direct in-app sharing features and more recording time to its users. We will continue working closely with Nate so that Soal becomes an app everybody wants on their mobile.
