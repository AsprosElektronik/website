As we’re slowly getting ready to host codequest’s first in-house hackathon, which we will cover in-depth very soon, I thought it's a good time to tell you why I believe hackathons are crucial for a software company like ours and why they might be substantial for yours too.

I’ve come up with a personal list of the five most critical elements of our hackathon. They might not make your TOP5 list obviously, but those listed below align with codequest’s big vision and goals.

## 1. **Education**

We firmly believe that education is the key to both personal and professional development. Our team attends meet-ups, conferences, and workshops on a regular basis. But what is education without practice?

The educational goal of our hackathon is to work with technologies you have never worked with before, which means that people will work on products with an entirely new stack. 

## 2. **Knowledge sharing**

Mixed teams during hackathon mean people learning a lot from each other. In every group we’ve created, there are developers on every level: junior, mid-level and seniors. That’s how we not only help less-experienced employees improve their skills, but we also give a proving ground to our senior staff who want to practice their project management skills or become more confident leaders.

## 3. **Integration**

When I started codequest, one of my primary goals was to create a family-oriented company culture. When recruiting, there are two things I focus on the most: skills and culture fit. Because at work, it’s not only about being the best engineer on the team; it’s about communicating with others and building friendships that last.

There’s a word “colleague” in English that describes a co-worker. However, I am proud to call all my “co-workers” friends. And I want everybody else to feel the same way. 

## 4. **New Ventures**

codequest is a venture studio; we help our customers turn ideas into excellent software products. But, we also build tools on our own. Our current in-house product is called codebeat.

[codebeat.co](https://codebeat.co/) is an automated static code review tool for developers. It supports nine languages. It's integrated with Slack, GitHub, and Bitbucket - including Pull Requests.

Hackathon is a perfect opportunity for our developers to start new ventures. Who knows? Maybe a prototype created during the event will become the next big thing?

## 5. **Fun**

However, with all that being said, our hackathon’s key aspect is simply to have fun. I want our teams to play with their ideas, be creative when it comes to execution and experiment with various technologies. Don’t be afraid to break stuff. Coding is fun, creating new things is fun. And that’s why our hackathons will always be about having fun.

We’re hosting our first hackathon on December, 12th - 16th, 2016. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay up to date with codequest’s news and events.
